### About Us

LifeSports is an non-profit organization dedicated to helping young students to stay on the path to success. We've created this app using React-App and then connecting it to our backend database using MongoDB.

### Usage

Run `$ npm install` in terminal

Run `$ npm start` to start app
```

#### Challenge Instructions

Our challenge was to create a working CRUD functionality to where the user can create, edit, and delete their exercises they posted. We had to link our React App to the backend, MongoDB. We did this by inputting the MongoDB username and password into our .env and using a process.env to hide our information. Then we created a cluster on Atlas and an app on heroku. The point of this was to enable a link between the two platforms and deploy our site this way.
